Thank you for installing Openl Git plugin.
Installation order

If you want, to install it globally,please enter
git openl install

Alternatively, initialise Git Openl locally (per repository), using the --local option, inside the root folder of your repository local working copy:
git openl install --local

After installing depending on mode (global,local) there is created file called git-openl.config in the same folder as .gitconfig file

E.g, in windows 10 with global option it will be:
C:\Users\<username>\git-openl.config
If local mode was chosen:
../<project folder>/.git/git-openl.config

If you want to change the Webstudio url, you can customize it by editing the git-openl.config file and setting the comparison_url parameter.
